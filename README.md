# ANGLES

Precompiled ANGLE libraries and headers for various platforms in a convenient CMake interface library.

For special platforms like Emscripten, compile options will be set to accommodate OpenGL ES3
without ANGLE.

Intended to help make builds convenient for development platforms.
For production, it may be necessary to compile ANGLE from source per platform.
